AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. In the context of the banking industry, AI can be used to analyze customer data, detect fraud, and provide personalized support to customers.

Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users. In the banking industry, chatbots can be used to provide customer support, answer frequently asked questions, and even complete simple transactions.

By combining AI with chatbots, banks can create a seamless and personalized banking experience for customers, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
