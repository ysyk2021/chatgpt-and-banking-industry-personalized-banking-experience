They help clients raise capital through underwriting, assist with mergers and acquisitions, and provide advisory services. Investment banks also engage in trading activities, buying and selling securities on behalf of clients or for their own account.

Credit Unions

Credit unions are non-profit organizations owned by their members, who typically share a common bond such as employment or membership in a particular organization. They provide banking services similar to commercial banks but operate on a smaller scale and often offer lower fees and interest rates to their members.

Insurance Companies

Insurance companies offer insurance policies to individuals and businesses to protect against financial losses due to unforeseen events such as accidents, natural disasters, or illness. They collect premiums from policyholders and use these funds to pay out claims when necessary.

Brokerage Firms

Brokerage firms provide investment-related services to individuals and businesses, including buying and selling securities such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. They also offer investment advice and research to help clients make informed decisions about their portfolios.
